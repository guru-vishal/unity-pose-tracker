# Unity Pose Tracker

A real-time avatar pose tracking system integrating **MediaPipe** for human pose estimation with a **Unity** client for 3D avatar animation.  
The system streams pose data from a Python server to Unity via WebSockets, mapping it to a Mixamo-rigged character in real time.

## üì¶ Dependencies

### Python (Server)
- Python 3.9 - 3.11
- MediaPipe ‚Äì Pose detection  
- OpenCV ‚Äì Video capture and processing  
- `websockets` ‚Äì Real-time data streaming to Unity  

### Unity (Client)
- Unity 2021.3 LTS (recommended)  
- NativeWebSocket ‚Äì WebSocket client for Unity  
- Mixamo character model (FBX) with humanoid rig  
- Custom C# scripts for bone mapping and animation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository or Download the zip file

    git clone https://github.com/guru-vishal/unity-pose-tracker.git

  ‚Ä¢ Or download the zip file and extract it

### 2. Python Server Setup

    cd "Python (Server)"
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python pose_server.py

  ‚Ä¢ 	Ensure your webcam is connected (or update the script for video file input).
  ‚Ä¢ 	The server will start sending pose data over WebSocket.

### 3.  Unity Client Setup

  - Open the Unity (Client) folder in Unity Hub.
  - Import the NativeWebSocket package.
  - Assign your Mixamo rigged avatar in the scene.
  - Link the bone mapping script to your avatar‚Äôs Animator.
  - Update the WebSocket URL in the script to match the Python server‚Äôs address.
  - Press Play to see the avatar mimic your movements in real time.

### 4. Challenges Faced

  ‚Ä¢ 	Coordinate Mapping ‚Äì Converting MediaPipe‚Äôs camera-space coordinates to Unity‚Äôs world-space.
  ‚Ä¢ 	Bone Orientation & Rotation Calibration ‚Äì Aligning MediaPipe joint rotations with Mixamo‚Äôs humanoid rig.
  ‚Ä¢ 	Mirroring & Root Rotation ‚Äì Correcting flipped movements and stabilizing the avatar‚Äôs facing direction.
  ‚Ä¢ 	Jitter Reduction ‚Äì Implementing smoothing filters to reduce noisy pose data.

### 5. Time Taken

  Time taken
    - Setup complete (Unity + Python env ready): ~ 1 hour
    - Python pose server (MediaPipe + OpenCV + WebSockets): ~ 1 hour
    - Unity client receives pose data over WebSocket: ~ 45 minutes
    - Avatar retargeting: bone mapping, smoothing, root follow: ~ 7 hours
    - Fixes: mirroring, root rotation, head tilt, scale alignment: ~ 1 hour
